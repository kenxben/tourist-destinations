# Scrapping toursit attractions
## Tourism in Ecuador
Jungle, Andes, beaches, Galapagos. Given its unique location and geography, Ecuador has a set of attractions so diverse that  visitors could enjoy a journey for almost any preference. Also, cities are close enough to travel between them by car in a few hours.

## Results summary
In this project, tourist destinations in Ecuador are identified from tourism attractions data scrapped from a trip recommendations site. The tourist destinations are then scored for their attributes, lodging availability and clustered by distance.
Results could be used to automatically design custom trips given a set of preferences.
